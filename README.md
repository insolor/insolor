### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

About me:

- Current job: Java Backend + Desktop Developer
  - Most used: Java 1.8, 11, 17
  - Java EE, Spring, etc. for server side
  - JavaFX, JFoenix for desktop
  - PostgreSQL databases
  
- Hobby Python developer since 2012-2013. Unfortunately, it doesn't directly translate into years of work experience, plus I haven't worked with popular frameworks (like Django).

- Current projects:
  - [The Dwarf Fortress fan localization project](https://github.com/dfint)
    - We develop tools for the localization and help enthisiasts with localization to different langauges (there are about 20 languages with an active localization progress)

  - **async-tkinter-loop** module: https://github.com/insolor/async-tkinter-loop
    - This is a small library which helps to use asynchronous code with tkinter GUI library for Python

  - Trying to revive the **pymorphy2** project: https://github.com/pymorphy2-fork
    - [**pymorphy2**](https://github.com/pymorphy2/pymorphy2) is a morphological analyzer and an inflection engine for Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, and potentially it can be used for other slavic languages. Right now the original project is abandoned (see [discussion](https://github.com/pymorphy2/pymorphy2/issues/160)), and I'm trying to continue it's development as a fork project.

- Active stackoverflow.com contributor (mostly on [ru.stackoverflow.com][1]):
