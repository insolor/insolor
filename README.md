### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

About me:

- Current job: Java Backend + Desktop Developer
  - Most used: Java 1.8, 11, 17
  - Java EE, Spring, etc. for server side
  - JavaFX, JFoenix for desktop
  - PostgreSQL databases
  
- Hobby Python developer since 2012-2013. Unfortunately, it doesn't directly translate into years of work experience, plus I haven't worked with popular frameworks (like Django).

- Current projects:
  - [The Dwarf Fortress fan localization project](https://github.com/dfint)
    - We develop tools for the localization and help enthisiasts with localization to different langauges (there are about 20 languages with an active localization progress)

  - **async-tkinter-loop** module: https://github.com/insolor/async-tkinter-loop
    - This is a small library which helps to use asynchronous code with tkinter GUI library for Python

  - Trying to revive the **pymorphy2** project: https://github.com/pymorphy2-fork
    - [**pymorphy2**](https://github.com/pymorphy2) is a morphological analyzer and an inflection engine for Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, and potentially it can be used for other slavic languages. Right now the original project is abandoned (see [discussion](https://github.com/pymorphy2/pymorphy2/issues/160)), so I'm trying to continue it's development as a fork project.
<!--

  - Other more or less significant contribution was a fix to the pymorphy2 project: https://github.com/pymorphy2/pymorphy2/pull/69
  - Lots of small fixes here and there, text fixes, translations, etc.

- Active stackoverflow.com contributor (mostly on [ru.stackoverflow.com][1]):

    [![Profile for insolor on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites][2]][3].

- Participated in the localization of such applications as [Poedit][4], [Spyder IDE][5], [Cutter][6] and others. See [my profile at crowdin.com][7].

<!--
- I'm also a language/language-learning enthusiast:
  - Bilingual person: Russian and Ukrainian
  - constantly learning English since school days (current level is somewhere between B1 and B2)
  - I understand speaking and writing in Belarusian (since it is very similar to Ukrainian and Russian)
  - I know a little bit of Polish from Duolingo and some other resources, up to the level of partial understanding of pop compositions in Polish (such artists as Daria ZawiaÅ‚ow, Mela Koteluk, The Dumplings, Sarsa, Sylwia Grzeszczak and others). The common vocabulary with the Ukrainian language and the knowledge of the logic of the sound differences between Polish and Ukrainian help a lot.
  - Now I'm struggling with Chinese. I don't know how far it will go.
  - I also know some Spanish, but very little.
